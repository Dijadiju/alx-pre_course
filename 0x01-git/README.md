My first directory in my alx-pre_course repo which will house my tasks
Created bash, c, and js directories and created the files c/c_is_fun.c, js/main.js, and js/index.js.
And created two bash files with content.
Created a new branch "update_script and edited the bash files and committed the change in this branch
I also created another branch "main" edited the bash files again and committed the changes in this branch.
I deleted the js directory and then committed all changes.
